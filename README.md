#  Voice-to-Email — A Voice-Controlled Email Web App

> Send emails using just your voice. Fully local, private, and browser-powered.

---

##  Overview

**Voice-to-Email** is a modern, speech-driven email application built with Python (Flask) and JavaScript. It allows users to **compose and send emails entirely through voice commands** — including selecting the recipient, writing the subject, composing the message, and sending.

This project was designed to be:
-  **Lightweight** – works locally without heavy libraries or cloud APIs  
-  **Secure** – uses Gmail App Passwords; no data is stored on any server  
-  **Accessible** – hands-free interface, ideal for users with disabilities or multitasking needs  

Whether you're visually impaired, on-the-go, or just want to try futuristic interaction, this app gives you a unique, local experience with no cloud dependencies.

##  How It Works

1. You speak your command: e.g.  
   - “Recipient Mohit”  
   - “Subject Hello”  
   - “Body How are you doing today?”  
   - “Send email”

2. The browser’s **Web Speech API** transcribes your voice into text

3. The text is injected into the respective input fields in real time

4. When you say “Send email,” a secure POST request is made via Flask to Gmail SMTP

5. Gmail securely delivers your message using your App Password

No third-party services  
No speech API keys  
Everything stays local

##  Gmail Setup (App Password Required)

For security, Gmail blocks less-secure login methods.  
To use this app:

1. Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)  
2. Generate an **App Password**
3. Use this App Password in the app — not your real password

>  Your credentials are used only at runtime and never saved.
